# simpleservoslider
convert simple pwm servo rotation to linear motion. <br />
The servo in this project could be (or similar to) Tower Pro SG92R. A slider (with a slot) sits on a linear guide + a rocker arm forms the linkage to do the rotation to linear motion convertion. <br />
To test this mechanism, a serial control setup was created. The program on the computer is writen in python with spyder IDE. 
The firmware runs on Arduino compatible MCUs.
